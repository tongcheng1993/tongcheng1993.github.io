            some strategies for learning english
        </h2>
        <p>
            learning english is <strong>by no means</strong> easy. it takes great <strong>diligence</strong> and
            <strong>prolonged effort</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            nevertheless,while you cannot expect to gain a good command of english without sustained hard work,there are
            various helpful learning strategies you can employ to make the task easier.here are some of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            1.do not treat all new words in exactly the same way.have you ever complained about your memory because you
            find it simply impossible to memorize all the new words you are learning?but,in fact,it is not your memory
            that is at fault.if you cram your head with too many new words at a time,some of them ard bound to be
            crowded out. what you need to do is to deal with new words in different ways according to how frequently
            they occur in everyday use.while active words demand constant practice and useful words must be committed to
            memory,words that do not often occur in everyday situations require just a nodding acquaintance.you will
            find concentrating on active and useful words the most effective route to enlarging your vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.watch out for idiomatic ways of saying things.have you ever wondered why we say,"i am interested in
            english",but "i am good at french"?and have you ever asked yourself why native english speakers say,"learn
            the news or secret",but"learn of someone's success or arrival"?these are all examples of idiomatic usage.in
            learning english,you must pay attention not only to the morning of a word,but also to the way native
            speakers use it in their daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>3.listen to english every day.listening to english on a regular basis will not only improve your ear,but will
            also help you build your speaking skills.in addition to language tapes especially prepared for your
            course,you can also listen to english radio broadcasts,watch english tv,and see english movies.</p>
