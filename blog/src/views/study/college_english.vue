            1.do not treat all new words in exactly the same way.have you ever complained about your memory because you
            find it simply impossible to memorize all the new words you are learning?but,in fact,it is not your memory
            that is at fault.if you cram your head with too many new words at a time,some of them ard bound to be
            crowded out. what you need to do is to deal with new words in different ways according to how frequently
            they occur in everyday use.
